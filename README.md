# jsonwebtoken
This Node.js API is built using the Express framework and incorporates JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication for secure user interactions. The API also implements a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error policy to facilitate controlled access from different origins.
Features:

## JWT Authentication:

User authentication is secured using ** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) **.
Upon successful login, the API issues a unique token that clients include in subsequent requests for authorization.
JWT tokens are signed with a secret key, enhancing security.
CORS Error Policy:

The API implements CORS middleware to control cross-origin requests.
Cross-origin requests are common when web applications hosted on one domain make requests to APIs on another domain.
The CORS middleware allows or restricts cross-origin requests based on configured policies.
Express Framework:

The API is built with the Express.js framework, known for its simplicity and flexibility in building web applications and APIs.
Usage:

## User Authentication:

The /login endpoint handles user login, expecting a JSON payload with a username and password.
Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is generated and returned to the client.
Protected Endpoint:

The /protected endpoint is protected by the ** JWT authorization middleware **.
Only requests with a valid JWT token in the Authorization header can access this endpoint.
CORS Configuration:

The API includes CORS middleware to manage cross-origin requests.
CORS policies can be customized based on specific requirements, allowing or restricting access from different origins.
Deployment:

The API can be deployed to production on platforms like Heroku, Vercel, Glitch, or Netlify, each offering a free tier for hosting.

## Getting Started (steps):
- git clone {RepositoryURL}
- npm install or yarn install
- node your-app.js
- Access the API at http://localhost:3000.
  
## Security Considerations:

In a production environment, ensure to use secure secret keys for signing JWT tokens.
Implement a robust user authentication mechanism, possibly connecting to a secure database to validate user credentials.
Note:

This is a basic example, and for a production-ready application, consider additional security measures and best practices.
